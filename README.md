A simple Currency Converter application

### Technical details:

Angular version: 17.1.0

The API used for this project: [Currencybeacon](https://currencybeacon.com/)

**Note:**
Due to the nature how the API handles conversions (everything in mid-market rates) the results for a direct and a middle currency conversion are nearly identical.
The lager numbers used the bigger the difference gets. 

<br>The JSON file that contains the currencies and the flags is from:

<br>I have just removed the ones that are unsupported by the API
